Angular Material Dashboard Demo

In this project I play around with Angular Material and Firebase. Probably some more frameworks, technologies and services will make it into this project as time goes by.

Some of the implemented features:
* Registration / Login / Logout
* Loading indicator
* Cards with tasks
* CRUD tasks and cards
* Drag and drop tasks
* Async image loading
* Sidenav with Gravatar

## Installation
* `$ git clone` Project
* Run `$ npm install`
* Run `$ bower install`
* Run `$ gulp`
